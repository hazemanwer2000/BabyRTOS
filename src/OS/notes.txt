
[1] The Timer.

    [*] The tick is based on the 'SysTick' timer, using its handler.
    [*] Configure the tick period yourself.
            (Note: The recommended tick period is 1 ms.)
    [*] 'OS_init' automatically enables the 'SysTick' interrupt.
    [*] 'OS_start' automatically enables the timer.
    [*] The priority of the 'SysTick' should be set per application requirements.
