
[1] The Timer.

    [*] The tick is based on the 'SysTick' timer, utilizing its handler.
    [*] Configure the tick period yourself.
            (Note: The recommended tick period is 1 ms.)
    [*] 'OS_init' automatically enables the interrupt.
    [*] 'OS_start' automatically enables the timer.
    [*] The priority of the timer should be set per application requirements.

[2] Interrupt.

    [*] 'OS_init' sets 'PRIGROUP' bitfield in 'AIRCR' register to '0b111', 
        disabling pre-emption.
    [*] Only 'OS_ISR...' calls should be made inside ISRs. 
        Likewise, only non-'OS_ISR..." calls should be made inside tasks.
